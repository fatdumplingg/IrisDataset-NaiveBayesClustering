# IrisDataset-NaiveBayesClustering

## ⭐ Project Name : Iris Dataset Clustering with Naive Bayes
## ⌛ Project Type : Academic Project
#### Notes : This project is dedicated as practice for the understanding of Gaussian Naive Bayes application using the widely-used Iris Dataset. In this case, the Naive Bayes calculations are coded manually, **without the use of machine learning libraries**.
