## Naive Bayes Clustering on Iris Dataset 

#### ⭐ Project Name : Iris Dataset Clustering with Naive Bayes
#### ⌛ Related Class : Machine Learning
#### 🔑 Keywords : Gaussian Naive Bayes
##### Notes : This project is dedicated as practice for the understanding of Gaussian Naive Bayes application using the widely-used Iris Dataset. In this case, the Naive Bayes calculations are coded manually, **without the use of machine learning libraries**.
